# React.js: Redux: Cart page (shopping cart)
## Description: You are on your way to finishing this insane project... 
Create the first of three cart pages - Shopping cart page.
Also, here you meet one of the most popular React library - Redux.
#### Variants -  (products that you are ‘selling’) the same as for previous works.
(see the description to 3rd work)
## Requirements: 
- All of the requirements for previous React.js works should be kept.
### Functionality:
- Item page: “Add to cart” action should be implemented using 
Redux flow: when you add an item to cart, it should be added to
your redux store. On Cart page you take all of the items from 
the store
- Cart page: “add/remove” actions should be implemented 
through redux actions & reducers as well.
### Code style: 
- Redux: All Redux parts (actions / reducers / store) should be 
kept in separate and specific files (actions.js / reducers.js / 
store.js etc.)
- Use useSelector hook for getting the data from redux store 
(instead of connect() function)

- Use useDispatch hook for dispatching your actions (instead of 
connect() function)
