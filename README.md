# React.js: Catalog page
## Description: Continue work on your React App by adding a page with 
Items list (see the link to wireframe of Catalog page above).
### Variants - (products that you are ‘selling’) the same as for previous works.
(see the description to 3rd work)
## Requirements: 
- All of the requirements for previous React.js works should be kept.
### Code style: 
- Use array.map() method for rendering your items list
- Routing (switching between pages) should work now. 
- Use react-router-dom library: 
`https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start`
- All UI elements (buttons / select) should have corresponding 
  React components (PrimaryButton.jsx / Select.jsx  etc.)
- Functionality (filter / search / view more) is still not required (you 
have to complete it on next works)
