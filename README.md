# React.js: Connecting to REST API
## Description: Finally! Now, you are about to put a final touches on all pages
you created - implement interaction with your REST API server.
### Variants -  (products that you are ‘selling’) the same as for previous works.
(see the description to 3rd work)
Backend - just as discussed before, can be the one you used for your 3-5 
work or a new one created from scratch. Tech stack - absolutely up to 
you. 
## Requirements: 
- All of the requirements for previous React.js works should be kept.
### Code style: 
- For any http request - use axios library
https://github.com/axios/axios#installing
- All your API functions should be separated into single file (or 
folder, if you want) - just like you saw in Live coding for 5 lab 
with fetch() function
## Functionality: 
- On Catalog Page - all items should now be fetched from your 
backend with GET method (using axios)
- Search with filters - should also be implemented with GET 
request (search by text field can be left as it is)
Hint: pass filters as url parameter
- Before response from your GET method is received you have 
to display a Spinner(Loader component) to the user. 
Something like this: https://projects.lukehaas.me/css-loaders/
