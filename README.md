# React.js: Item page
## Description: Continue work on your React App by adding a page for  your 
Item (see the link to wireframe of Item page above). Also, now, you have to
make all your previous pages (Home & Catalog) more interactive.
### Variants -  (products that you are ‘selling’) the same as for previous works.
(see the description to 3rd work)
## Requirements: 
- All of the requirements for previous React.js works should be kept.
### Code style: 
- Your items should be stored inside the state or context (your 
choice) of your page
https://uk.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html
https://uk.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext
- For your state management use useState() inside Functional 
Component  instead of this.state and Class component
- If you decided to use context, use useContext() hook instead of 
Context.Consumer

## Functionality (IMPORTANT):
- Home page: “View more” button should display more elements
on the same page Tip: Elements can be just random paragraph
& heading, use your imagination ;)
- Catalog page: You should be able to filter your items list, by 
applying different filters by item's properties (i.e size/color/type)
- Catalog page: Search by any text property option should also 
work
- Catalog & Item pages: “View more” action on every item 
should refer to corresponding Item page, with correct 
information about item (get the info from your state/context)
